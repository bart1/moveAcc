# moveAcc

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Design

* Keep frequency and axes per element or for the vector? -> per element as it changes within study
* Allow NA's? -> yes in vector , no in burst?
* Are start time part of vector? -> probably not as move2 already keeps it
* Calibrated (in G) or Uncalibrated -> might be covered by storing units
* We assume constant sampling freq in a burst


## Installation

You can install the development version of moveAcc like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(moveAcc)
## basic example code
```
