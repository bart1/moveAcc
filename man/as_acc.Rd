\title{Convert to acc}
\usage{
as_acc(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{move2} containing acceleration data as collected by EOBS or ornitella tracking devices. Most of the time
this will be either loaded from disk using \link[move2:mt_read]{move2::mt_read} or downloaded using \link[move2:movebank_download_study]{move2::movebank_download_study}.}

\item{...}{currently not used}
}
\description{
In many cases the \code{as_acc} function will directly create an acceleration vector from input data
}
\details{
The resulting vector will be as long as the input. This means it can, for example, be added as a column to a
\code{data.frame}. For some tags this means \code{NA} values are inserted when one burst is stored over multiple rows of a
\code{data.frame}.
