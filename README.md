## Design

- Keep frequency and axes per element or for the vector? -\> per element
  as it changes within study
- Allow NAâ€™s? -\> yes in vector , not in burst?
- Are start time part of vector? -\> probably not as move2 already keeps
  it
- Calibrated (in G) or Uncalibrated -\> might be covered by storing
  units
- We assume constant sampling freq in a burst

## Installation

You can install the development version of move2Acc like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bart1/move2Acc")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
